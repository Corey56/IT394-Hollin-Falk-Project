# Problem Statement
### by CDTs Falk & Hollin
# 
##   The problem that we plan to address with our project is that the 
## popular application Jodel, which is commonly used by service 
## academy cadets and military personnel, is not specific to the West
## Point community. 
##   In order to address this problem, we will create our own version
## of social media exclusively for cadets. Improvements we will make
## to the existing model include user registration and profile pages.
## These improvements will lend validity to posts that are made 
## and can be used to generate metadata such as class or major
## aggregate karma and posts.
