# Problem Statement
### by CDTs Falk & Hollin

  The problem that we plan to address with our project is that the 
 popular application Jodel, which is commonly used by service 
 academy cadets and military personnel, is not specific to the West
 Point community. Often times there are people from outside of the West Point community that comment on Cadet issues and we can not tell who is real and who is fake. This leads to users not trusting the information put on by certain members and causes unnecessary arguments. This West Point specific app will allow the community to directly interact with eachother and buld trust in the posts created
   In order to address this problem, we will create our own version
 of social media exclusively for cadets. Improvements we will make
 to the existing model include user registration and profile pages.
 These improvements will lend validity to posts that are made 
 and can be used to generate metadata such as class or major
 aggregate karma and posts.
